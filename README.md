# CFP Compass

**CFP Compass** is a call-for-speakers aggregator that helps community speakers discover open CFPs (Call For Papers). Its purpose is to ease the process of finding speaking opportunities by compiling and maintaining an up-to-date listing of open calls for speakers.

Currently, this project consists of a C# console application that builds the [cfp_tracker.md](cfp_tracker.md) document.
