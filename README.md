# CFPCompass
CFP Compass is a call-for-speakers finder project that aggregates current CFPs for community speakers. Built with .NET, C#, and Azure SQL, the system initially generates markdown files for GitHub-hosted listings, with plans to evolve into an Azure Static Web App featuring advanced search.
